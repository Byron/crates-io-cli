# The way this works is a little weird. But basically, the create-release job
# runs purely to initialize the GitHub release itself. Once done, the upload
# URL of the release is saved as an artifact.
#
# The build-release job runs only once create-release is finished. It gets
# the release upload URL by downloading the corresponding artifact (which was
# uploaded by create-release). It then builds the release executables for each
# supported platform and attaches them as release assets to the previously
# created release.
#
# The key here is that we create the release only once.
